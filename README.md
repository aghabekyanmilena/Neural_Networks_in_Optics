### Weather Prediction Using Reservoir Computing

This project focuses on weather prediction using a Reservoir Computing neural network. The model leverages a cleaned weather dataset and predicts temperature based on various meteorological indicators. While the model exhibits slight overfitting in some scenarios, its predictive performance remains robust for practical use
