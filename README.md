### Weather Prediction Using Reservoir Computing

This project focuses on weather prediction using a Reservoir Computing neural network. The model leverages a cleaned weather dataset and predicts temperature based on various meteorological indicators. While the model exhibits slight overfitting in some scenarios, its predictive performance remains robust for practical use

For more detailed insights and explanations, please refer to the accompanying project report.
